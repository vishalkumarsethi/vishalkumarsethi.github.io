                        <p style="height: auto;color: rgb(0,0,0);font-size: 17.6;font-family: Lato, sans-serif;">Been a week. Not much happened this week, but I'll include some stuff down below in "Thoughts". Also I have recently enjoyed using the word "Cheers" much more often. Variety in word usage is always welcome. Hands in the air for
                            linguistics and language!&nbsp;<br>________________________________________________________________<br><strong>What I'm reading:&nbsp;</strong><br>No super interesting papers I dived into this week. Hopefully this won't happen
                            often.&nbsp;<br><br>For thoes who are interested in children's health, pediatric disease, rare diseases, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and medicine, I found reading about the diseases on St. Jude's Children's Hospital list of
                            indications they treat to be actually VERY informative and fun. They distill complex rare conditions into well written and simple explanations, and provide sufficient statistics and information about how they care for children
                            with said condition. I LOVE this page.&nbsp;<br><br>https://www.stjude.org/disease.html<br><br>Sam Altman's new post got a LOT of attention for very obvious reasons.&nbsp;<br><br>http://blog.samaltman.com/<br><br>Elements<br>Pretty
                            cool book. Who would have knew? /s<br>_______________________________________________________________<br><strong>What I'm working on:&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Learning a bit about some tech stuff, and by tech stuff I mean trying
                            to resolve some DNS issues on Cloudflare. I know, very dissapointing.&nbsp;<br><br>I discovered this channel on Youtube called "NileRed"&nbsp;<br>If you like science, check it out.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/user/TheRedNile/videos<br>________________________________________________________________<br><strong>Thoughts:&nbsp;</strong><br><br>I
                            must say that this new "foodplan" I am trying it is pretty interesting. Essentially just high protein and low (read: basically none?) carbs, which as long as other micronutrients are consumed should be fine to consume. I was
                            advised that high protein is ok so long as you consume large amounts of water (and it doesn't hurt to exercise as well). Noted.<br><br>Essentially, we have eggs/oatmeal for breakfast, beef or chicken for lunch and then dinner
                            is the same as lunch. Along with baby carrots, salad, fruits (citrus, bananas, blueberries), and some seasonings/sauces, we have a very simple but sufficient food plan. Of course, there is room for tomatoes, avocados, and sweet
                            potatoes (the #1 carb of all time), but given sweet potatoes take more than a few minutes to prepare we have deferred them for now. Will try later and update.<br><br>Definitely not as "satiating" as a high carb or "outside-food"
                            diet, but most people agree that carbs can be heavy as well as no outside food brings total food costs down considerably. $10 for a meal is CRAZY.&nbsp;<br><br>I know that three things one should try their best not to sacrifice
                            quality for is a mattress, shoes, and the food they eat, but outside food is very, very expensive.&nbsp;<br><br>I want to comment on dreams next time.&nbsp;<br><br>Also congrats to the Patriots! I mean, I've been a Colts fan
                            since forever and am indifferent toward Brady, but I don't like the Rams, so Patriots it is. Game was VERY boring, but what can you do. Anyways, GOAT.&nbsp;<br><br>Usually, most people will either, to put it simply, be a fan
                            of kids and others will not be. This obviously changes with time. Not sure what this means or that it matters, but mainly I mentioned it to just say that I feel this is a binary operation (haha). Hit or miss.&nbsp;<br><br>Doing
                            sports makes physical exercise more stressful but MUCH more fun. Mostly competition, but also acheivement/mastery. Being good in ANYTHING (e.g. cutting green onions) makes people feel very good. Hard to beat the satisfaction
                            from skill/mastery. Not even money can compete I would wager.&nbsp;<br><br>Music is amazing. Namely classical/instrumental music, highly-lyrical music, and nostalgic music (songs/tunes you listened too in the past).&nbsp;<br><br>No
                            photos today. Have a wonderful week. -vish<br><br><br></p>

                            these short posts, I'll probably just open a journal, pick a random article, and highlight here. Longer posts will attempt to have more curated papers/advanced papers like Nature or something random: possibly selected from
                            here.&nbsp;<br>https://www.omicsonline.org/scientific-journals.php<br><br>Pharmacological Treatments for Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome:&nbsp;<br>A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis. Disher et. al. JAMA Pediatr.2019.doi:10.1001<br>This
                            was the first article I found on JAMA Pediatrics today; although it is a review paper, I didn't know much about NAS so I didn't mind reading about it (tl;dr: babies get withdrawal symptoms after birth when mom takes narcotics
                            during pregnancy). <br>Apparently morphine sucks for NAS; interesting. Even though morphine is standard-of-care I still don't like it that much. &nbsp;No one likes pruritus* (side note:&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0885-3924(98)00115-8">https://doi.org/10.1016/S0885-3924(98)00115-8</a>&nbsp;is
                            a kind of random case study on morphine-induced pruritus. I admit I am not very familiar with this but I can't be the only one who prefers/tolerates dilaudid&gt;morphine (from personal exp.))<br><br>Back on topic;<br>https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=neonatal-abstinence-syndrome-90-P02387
                            has some information on NAS...a brief overview.&nbsp;<br><br>The paper itself just seems to review a bunch of RCTs** and found buprenorphine or suboxone to be best, and phenobarbital/morphine to be worst. I mean...I don't have
                            a MD but I would gather that a drug to treat opioid dependence would work well? Maybe I'm missing something here. The "kind of?" obvious was stated, no serious evidence/conclusion was reached, I don't know. 3/10 paper.&nbsp;<br><br>*
                            = itching<br>** = Randomized Controlled Trials<br>________________________________________________________________<br><strong>What I'm working on:&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Texts for classes listed below:<br>A First Course in Abstract
                            Algebra. Fraleigh 7th ed.<br>paged through it; seems more digestible then some other abstract texts. cool.&nbsp;<br>Linear Algebra done Right (huh?). Axler 3rd ed.<br>A prof at SJSU wrote a "textbook" aka review book/supplementary
                            &nbsp;text for Linear; prof decides to use it as primary text. Book is actually so good and makes concepts seem relatable/simplified. Good beginner text for 2nd year linear I guess (and probably first year too).&nbsp;<br><br>Nothing
                            else at the moment. Likely next week I'll pick something else up.&nbsp;<br><br>Elements~<br>________________________________________________________________<br><strong>Thoughts:&nbsp;</strong><br><br>I was thinking about food/eating/diet/cost/efficiency/health
                            a bit earlier. Most people would agree that they WANT to be healthy, so they are receptive to changes/ideas about how to improve health. Food seems to play an important part since we seem to need it to live, so we'll start
                            here. We'll assume that drinkable water is readily available, along with other basic resources. <br><br>Side note: the water/food problem is still on the way to being solved; in an alternate universe I would help with that
                            but not for this life unfortunately. &nbsp;Maybe in my lifetime? Hopefully. I'm not a food scientist but I take it GMOs and new tech will help with that.&nbsp;<br><br>Water should be consumed in decently high volumes on the
                            basis that our bodies contain/run on water, there is a lot of water on the earth, and that if humans don't drink it in low amounts we die. Sounds reasonable.&nbsp;<br><br>I would imagine "recommended" amounts/values for MOST
                            THINGS by the USDA/FDA/other health organizations are reputable and good, but they are just that. Good. It is hard for a large majority of the population to take a great recommendation if it is much harder e.g. If we ran a
                            trial for people to drink 40oz, 60oz, 80oz, 100oz of water...compliance would decrease as you increase volume? I still think this makes sense.&nbsp;<br><br>Enough about water.&nbsp;<br><br>A stove, pan, microwave, and some
                            utensils can be used with a diet consisting of chicken, rice, veggies (frozen or salad), and supplementary items. Get some meat, carbs, veggies, fruits (citrus, blueberries). Sounds "balanced" and rather easy.&nbsp;<br><br>Eating
                            the same thing every day, given that this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">food plan</span> (diet isn't the right word IMO) has necessary macro/micronutrients is probably pretty good. Predictable, efficient, rather
                            easy.&nbsp;<br><br>Of course, it gets "boring" since humans thrive on novelty in EVERY aspect of life...so we decorate with seasoning/salt and sauces. Calories, sodium intake is whatever. Generally humans seem to have problems
                            with TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE of things...so I guess "moderation is key" is very valuable.&nbsp;<br><br>There is always more to say, but for another time.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, if you make chicken on a pan, be careful. Tenderloins
                            will sear quicker then they will cook on the inside if on high heat. Breasts and other chicken/meats vary but should be better...usually.&nbsp;<br><br>This turned into a very long and scattered post; my apologies. Here is a
                            cool picture from Reddit.&nbsp;<br><br>Reddit is pretty cool too; highly recommend.<br><br>2hrslater: I realized that I may just compile a bunch of rants/thoughts/ideas into a seperate post/article and keep the same format
                            here.

Cheers to a good semester of work, progress, and a little bit of fun.&nbsp;<br>________________________________________________________________<br><strong>What I'm reading:&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Effect
                            of Fecal Microbiota Trasnplantation on 8-Week Remission in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis. Costello et. al. JAMA<em>&nbsp;</em>2019;321(2):156-164.<br>Since FMT &nbsp;began to become more popular with treating C. Diff, it
                            seemed logical to think it may aid with GI issues as well...essentially stuff related to microbiome. This new way of aerobically preparing samples is good progress. The results didn't seem TOO impressive but obviously still
                            impressive (12/38 from test group acheived remission vs. 3/35 from placebo...not bad!).&nbsp;<br>Still some ways to go.&nbsp;<br><br>(BTW, Mendeley is something I have found to be very resourceful for managing my PDFs/articles.
                            Highly recommend.)<br><br>Elements \\ Euclid<br>I'ma put this on the bottom always and not comment anymore on it since I'm moving at what seems to be one page per week.&nbsp;<br><br>Didn't get to read much this week. :(<br>________________________________________________________________<br><strong>What I'm working on:&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Just
                            starting a new semester of classes at school, so new subjects include but are not limited to: Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, and POSSIBLY some environmental science stuff. Still working on chemistry. <br><br>Maybe soon I'll
                            finish the tutorials I started x years ago on Code.org.&nbsp;<br>________________________________________________________________<br><strong>Thoughts:&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Patriots vs. Chiefs goodness me. Tom Brady is pretty
                            good at this football thing.&nbsp;<br><br>Was talking with someone about the idea of "sacrifice now for better later" or "enjoy now at the expense of later". This idea can be worded in an infinite amount of ways of course.
                            An example that may relate to students (rather cliche) is to spend a night studying or go party. &nbsp;It is very hard to quantify the gain from 1, 2, or x hours of studying vs. a night with potentially high levels of fun and
                            novelty, but most people would agree that hard things take time, and that time needs to be put in somewhere e.g. habits.&nbsp;<br><br>Right now I'm not certain on which is better; pretty sure it would vary per the situation.&nbsp;<br><br>Pro
                            Tip: Keeping a bottle of Purell/your choice of hand sanitizer on a desk or work area or in a high traffic area is VERY worth.&nbsp;<br>The benefits of being able to sanitize your hands easily and in a very conveinent manner
                            outweighs the extra cost. A 10oz bottle will last you a whole 365 days EASILY, but likely 2+ years.&nbsp;<br>Also, when your hands feel dry or "dirty", it seems to fix that problem too.&nbsp;<br><br>If not, then a sink and
                            some hand soap will be good too.&nbsp;<br>Don't wanna get sick during flu/cold/sniffle season!&nbsp;<br><br>Also, don't forget to stay warm in these colder months!&nbsp;<br>Nothing beats a warm puffy jacket and some gloves.&nbsp;<br><br>Til
