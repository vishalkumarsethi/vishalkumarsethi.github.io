I spend a lot of my free time just developing&nbsp;beratberkeley.com (check it out!)&nbsp;and relevant affairs.<br><br>Also decided that instead of uploading photos here I'll just upload them to instagram
                            (easier) and just link it. May not be as pleasant since galleries of photos on websites are easily viewable as well...but I guess a link is easier then "link --&gt; page" ? <br><br>We'll see! Doesn't matter too much. &nbsp;<br>_______________________________________________________________<br><strong>What I'm reading:&nbsp;</strong><br>A
                            few things.&nbsp;<br><br>I'll list some papers which I read here but may not comment much on them. On beratberkeley.com, I write more formal and intensive paper summaries with some insights (not as casual which has pros and
                            cons but whatever). So go check there for some more extensive journal reviews since anything I would just write here before I'll just post there.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, last week I said I would go in depth on a paper regarding
                            chronic disease management for crohn's disease? Yeah, it was this paper.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Theory-Based Health Behavior Interventions for Pediatric Chronic Disease Management:</strong>A Systematic Review<br><em>JAMA Pediatr.&nbsp;</em>2018;172(12):1177-1186.
                            doi:10.1001/jamapediatrics.2018.3039<br><br>Looks like I can't read; it was CHRONIC disease management, not CROHN'S disease management. Regardless, it was informative.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>Olive Oil Effects on Colorectal Cancer</strong><br>Borzi

                            to IBD-related deaths so this paper cleared some misconcpetions. Of course people would assume toxic megacolon and any complication related to CRC and other types of cancers would be IBD-related deaths (so to speak) but there
                            are obviously other things like old age, pnemonia, and COPD. They are not SUPER SUPER related but I guess coincide with IBD so they have to be included. Just my two cents.&nbsp;<br><br><br>________________________________________________________________<br><strong>Thoughts:&nbsp;</strong><br>S
                            = sinister. if you know you know.&nbsp;<br><br>On top of dance and music, art is also a very interesting medium to explore. Most recently, been looking at it via photos. Hence the lifestyle instagram page for random photos
                            I linked under "Photos". Check it out if you want too!<br><br>Not much else to say to be honest. I need to sit down and collect some past and present thoughts and write some substantial then this random stuff to be honest.
                            But it's casual in nature so I don't mind.&nbsp;<br><br>If you or some friends want to play a fun game, check out Geoguessr! Surprisingly fun!&nbsp;<br><br>Should start looking into Series tests as well. Maybe later.&nbsp;<br><br>I

                            website in line with some project I am doing, but I want to include them here (sometimes) since that place is more formal and very casual thoughts aren't appropriate there but rather here. <br><br>I'll show what this means
                            next time. <br><br>These were all things I just opened one day on JAMA Ped. and all three were rather interesting or at least posed something to think about.&nbsp;<br>All recent to March 8th, 2019.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Association of Atopic Dermatitis With Sleep Quality in Children.

                            feel if you would think about it, you would expect impaired sleep in at least a moderate to severe AD population (which is true), but also applies to mild. Granted, I am not super familiar with the sensations and feelings of
                            mild vs. moderate vs. severe AD, but yeah it matters.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Chemotherapy and Supportive Care Agents as Essential Medicines for Children With Cancer.</strong> Unguru et. al.&nbsp;<br><em>JAMA Pediatr.&nbsp;</em>doi:10.1001/jamapediatrics.2019.0070<br>I
                            really like this article. Recommend if you want some exposure to medications for peds onc! I really see it more so as an organization tool, since everyone expects ketamine/midazolam/heparin (more household names) to be used
                            constantly on a onc ward...but I mean I don't know many onco drugs myself like Etoposide. Also, Tretinoin on the first list? What?

                            rather medicine in general.&nbsp;<br>Miller's Anesthesia Review; 2nd ed. is a cool one to PAGE through (read: it is rather DENSE). No reason for this one. Just because.&nbsp;<br><br>Elements is on the backburner for now.&nbsp;<br>________________________________________________________________<br><strong>Thoughts:&nbsp;</strong><br>Unfortunate
                            to hear that Alex Trebek, host of Jeopardy, was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. Gave me a reason to learn a bit more about pancreatic cancer. From some limited research, pancreatic cancer has a STAGGERING low survival
                            rate, on the level (kind of) of DIPG and Glioblastomas. Damn.&nbsp;<br><br>Dreams.&nbsp;<br>I said a lot of what I wanted to say last time actually, but the general idea of exploring a world which doesn't exist and sometimes
                            gaining full autonomy in those dreams (lucid dreaming) is insane as a concept. Heavily inspired by Inception (if you couldn't tell).&nbsp;<br><br>Some cool things I wanted to mention.&nbsp;<br><br>Personally I feel there is
                            meaning to dreams but they cannot be read into that deep. Some nights one feels primed to dream and/or remember more than others? If I am more sleep deprived and sleep at a super late hour AND set my alarm to wake up unnecessarily
                            early, I'll have more active dreams vs. a 8hr rest? Not even concepts I am actively thinking about before I sleep may pop up into a dream, but very weird connections to things I passively saw appear and are relevant. What I
                            mean by this is:&nbsp;<br>I had watched a video (topic not relevant) and in the background there was some individual drinking tea or something. That individual was like the main character in my dream. Odd.&nbsp;<br><br>It is
                            fun to share and try to explain the meanings behind dreams. Personally I have had enough "scary dreams" or "thrillers" to not be very afraid of them, but trying the totem trick has made me sometimes uneasy in dreams as to whether
                            I fully recognize I am dreaming.&nbsp;<br><br>I'll have a dream where I half-recognize I am dreaming yet the dream doesn't collapse, yet things are very odd from that point forward. Just not odd enough for it to be a full realization.
                            I don't know, it's complicated.&nbsp;<br><br>Anyways, dreams are cool.&nbsp;<br><br>Dance is also pretty cool.&nbsp;<br><br>Music is still cool.&nbsp;<br><br>Design is <strong>very </strong>cool. Good design is very underrated
                            in my opinion. &nbsp;<br><br>Some food for thought(s) to end this post:&nbsp;<br>Who is more "successful": a teacher making $55,000 teaching fourth grade? Or a software engineer working at (insert tech company) making (not
                            including stock options and/or other compensation) $100,000?&nbsp;<br><br>Personally I'm on the former, but it can depend on what "successful". Perhaps "more important" or "impactful" is a better word? Hard to say.<br><br>I
                            could include the thought experiment which looks somewhat like "A train is on track to hit 100 people who do not know of the train. You can divert it to hit 1 person who is aware of the train. Do you change the fate?"<br><br>AN
                            interesting idea and I may include more philosophy in future posts, but yeah this one makes you think for a sec.&nbsp;<br><br>Otherwise, til next time! No picture sorry. :(<br><br>cheers<br>-vish</p>

So crushing goodness this sucks.
                            Whatever I'll try and re-write it at the expense of organization/fluidity/clarity since I attempted to write it well the first time. Damn. &nbsp;<br>________________________________________________________________<br><strong>What I'm reading:&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Efficacy
                            and safety of adjunctive ezogabine (retigabine) in refractory partial epilepsy. Brodie et. al. &nbsp;Neurology doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181fd6170<br>Cool. &nbsp;I have always been a fan of companies working to broaden the
                            # of indications a drug treats, hence what XENE is doing. For an example, look at the space of autoimmune disorders. There is a LOT of overlap of Humira/Enbrel/Remicade/Entyvio/Xeljanz/etc. in treating AI disorders, but then
                            the question of whether a drug should treat a specific indication VERY WELL and whether it will somewhat work/not work at all for other indications OR the idea that drugs can equally treat multiple conditions. Usually it seems
                            to be the former (obviously it depends on the conditions and the specifics) but there is definitely overlap. I'll talk about it later a bit but LOXO (a very successful startup over the past 5 years~) worked to treat a type
                            of tumor based on its genes and not necessarily a type of cancer.&nbsp;<br><br>Anything related to KCNQ2 conditions (classifies essentially neonatal epilepsy and neonatal epileptic encephalopathy.&nbsp;<br>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK32534/<br>Very
                            cool. &nbsp;I am in huge support and ABSOLUTELY LOVE research/R&amp;D work on pediatric orphan conditions.&nbsp;<br><br>As you can may be able to tell, a drug company broadening a pre-approved drug to pediatric orphan diseases?
                            Actually heroes. Period. Thank god we have huge financial incentives for healthcare; otherwise no one would care about sick people, <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ESPECIALLY</span></em></strong> groups
                            of small but VERY sick people. Things always fall back to the main dogma:<br><br>PRICE * VOLUME = SALES<br><br>If this didn't hold true in healthcare then everyone would just treat high cholesterol and obesity. But, thanks
                            to innovation and progress in the past few decades, we have drugs like Folotyn and Naglazyme and Cerezyme and we need Cerezyme to cost $334,000 (wikipedia quotes $200K annual cost so take #s with a grain of salt. It's expensive
                            to say the least) for lifetime (~20 yrs hence around $6-7million total lifetime cost (?)) since only .0025% of the population gets it. Yeah. .0025%. 1 in 40K live births. So if your kid ends up getting type 1 Gaucher disease,
                            you will do/pay <strong>anyone anything to help your child.&nbsp;</strong><br>BTW, Gaucher disease is a genetic disorder requiring enzyme replacement therapy~ (think clotting factor replacement therapy for hemophilia patients).&nbsp;<br><br>The
                            reason I bring this up is that people sometimes don't understand drug pricing and are just very misunderstood. See this chart below. Don't concern yourself with the details. Disclaimer: I am not an expert on this but I am pretty
                            sure I am not a complete novice either.&nbsp;<br><br><img src="/assets/img/drug%20company%20profit%20chart.png?h=a90cf46b040cf6b7236c94a6e00a498d" style="width: 500px;height: 300px;"><br><br>The takeaway is a drug company needs a VERY VERY LARGE initial investment in drug development, then
                            when approved it will make money first to recoup the money spent, THEN it will generate profit for x years until patent expiry.&nbsp;<br><br>There are MANY exceptions and details which make this chart a very simplified/general
                            concept, but the idea of how drug companies can make money AND make drugs still holds.&nbsp;<br><br>On the same vein, the whole concept of insurance (I really like how this is said) is<strong><em> to account for exotic risk.</em></strong>                            Everyone pays their monthly premiums because no one wants to be the patient who has to pay cash for their PNH treatment ($500,000 per year for life). The reason Soliris costs a bunch of money is because for the ~500 people
                            diagnosed per year with PNH, if no treatment was available they would die. No god will save or cure them. And there is no motivation for Alexion (ALXN) to treat such a small condition (read: LOW VOLUME) without charging a high
                            $ (read: PRICE) in order to maximize...? Sales of course.&nbsp;<br><br>Hope this is informative and clears up some misconceptions. There is much much MUCH more to talk about here and the system is not without MANY MANY faults.
                            But one does what they can I suppose.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br>Anyways, on a different topic...<br><br>I never really looked into Loxo's story so this helped a bit for understanding Vitrakvi (kind of)<br><br>Rapid Response

                            differences wouldn't hurt.&nbsp;<br><br>I also LOVE&nbsp;https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/<br><br>You can literally look up any FDA approved drug and read absolutely everything about it, both high-level summaries
                            and in-depth results from trials and why it was approved (e.g. showed x% efficacy or y base-point noninferiority to z competitor, etc.). Actually insane.&nbsp;<br><br>Literally finding/cataloging/organizing information is as
                            important (and sometimes more important but depends!) as interpreting it.<br>_______________________________________________________________<br><strong>What I'm working on:&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Been doing a bunch of biotech
                            equity research; recently working on project about Xenon Pharma (XENE), essentially their main candidate is an already approved FDA epilepsy drug that they just need to get approval to run a PhIII (n=20~?) for a very specific
                            type of epileptic encephalopathy. Definitely atypical in terms of normal biotech equity research since a lot of work goes into revenue models and not safety/efficacy/pharm profiles. Whatever. Hence publications above; still
                            paging through them.&nbsp;<br><br>Methylene blue is actually SUPER versatile (maybe this is obvious but seems new to me). Dyes are cool. If you want to see why, check the wikipedia page and see what it is used for. tl;dr a
                            bunch of stuff.&nbsp;<br><br>Reading about antidepressants lately as well. Not really for personal reasons but more so for information. Seems that Celexa is the most prescribed antidepressant since tricyclic drugs seem to have
                            increased CV (cardiovascular aka heart) problems (more likely to cause arrhythmias~), and so the new guys (not really new~) a.k.a SSRIs seem to dominate right now. They still have issues, but in general people think they are
                            better? Think that sounds right.&nbsp;<br><br>Celexa also seems to match other antidepressant's efficacy, have minimal side effects, and is overall pretty clean (?).&nbsp;<br><br>Making a website which applies to a certain
                            topic, but for some reasons I'd rather keep personal hence I can't link it here. Just a bunch of words. If you find it, nice; please drop a note saying you found it and provide some feedback.&nbsp;<br><br>I'll write it here
                            what it is in like a few months/years/whenever in a while.&nbsp;<br>________________________________________________________________<br><strong>Thoughts:&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Music is VERY cool. If I had three things on an
                            island save food/water/a knife for utility/shelter, I would take some form of infinite music.&nbsp;<br><br>NYC is interesting as well; it's a different vibe. IF you have been you know sort of what I am talking about.&nbsp;<br><br>IF
                            you want to get some laughter in, check out Impractical Jokers. <br><br>I have started trying this thing called dancing. Seems to be cool so far.&nbsp;<br><br>Opportunistic infections are a new topic for me; infectious diseases
                            are generally pretty cool but not really actually but kind of. Other disciplines seem to be more intricate and exciting.&nbsp;<br><br>I said I would comment on dreams (rather extensively)&nbsp;this time; postponed til next
                            time. <br><br>But something you can do today is <br>a) Watch Inception <br>and <br>b) Get yourself a totem and actually dream-check during the day. &nbsp;<br><br>If you don't know what b) is, reference a). :)<br><br>Trust me
                            it actually worked the first day I tried it. <br>Quick run-down: When you get a totem (pinching self is fine but a totem is more advanced), throughout the day you have to stop and think "Am I dreaming?". So, you would stop,
                            look around, and then pinch yourself. IF you can feel it and things seem in order, you are like "Ok, I'm not dreaming"...BUT YOU NEED TO INITIALLY THINK YOU ARE DREAMING. Once you get more advanced, move from pinching to an
                            item. A spinning top is used in the movie as well as a loaded die or weighted chess piece, but having a poker chip is cool too. Toss it up in the air and FULLY BELIEVE it'll float. Be surprised (I am not joking even though
                            this sounds stupid) that it falls back down (yay for gravity!). <br><br>The first day I did this like 4-5 times a day. That night I had a nightmare (guy trying to kill me with a gun I am not kidding) and I ran inside a truck
                            door and my brain just told myself "Wait, am I dreaming?" I just reach for my arm to pinch it and after a few seconds the dream collapses. <br><br>True. Story. Try it. I love stuff like this because you need literally....<br><br><strong><em>N O T H I N G </em></strong>&nbsp;<br><br>...to
                            do it. No money, no fame, no priviliege. I don't care if you sleep on a nice mattress or in a sleeping bag on the floor or on a carpet outside. You can have fun/manipulate your dreams.&nbsp;<br><br>Will talk more next time;
                            but <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CAUTION: &nbsp;PLEASE READ ABOUT THIS STUFF AND BE INFORMED so you know what you are getting yourselves into.&nbsp;</span></em></strong><br><br>Never take any pills
                            also for lucid dreaming and stuff. Trust me.&nbsp;<br><br>I'll talk more next post. If you can't tell, I love the dream world.&nbsp;<br><br><br>On a kind of related but not really note!!! See below:&nbsp;<br>I'll leave you
                            with one more thought that is either SUPER SUPER interesting or (in a few cases) you may already be familiar with it.&nbsp;<br><br>Let's say you are sleeping in a room with either a friend, roommate, family, and they may be
                            snoring or breathing heavily and this may prevent you from falling asleep. Either snap your fingers, clap your hands, or make a sound at varied levels (usually with increasing volume). The goal is to not wake them up but "reset"
                            their sleeping/breathing pattern. I have NO IDEA HOW IT WORKS BUT IT WORKS. It is as interesting as the tinnitus trick found commonly on Reddit.<br><br>Maybe since a sleeping human recognizes a noise and attempts to respond
                            to it, but depending on how deep they are sleeping and what stage this will change their pattern but not wake them up. Pure speculation.<br><br>Some of these thoughts are "obvious" but taking note of them is where the novelty
                            and cool components come from. Similar to appreciating items. Some may say it is being grateful or being humble but those are not the right words. Appreciating stuff/experiences/sensory is cool too.&nbsp;<br><br>New thought:&nbsp;Hardships,
                            especially health ones, build the most resilience. I don't intend for this to be controversial, as the whole idea of trying to objectively compare hardship/struggle is so so so so harsh and sort of desensitizes one (sometimes)
                            to the idea of compassion. Don't forget though, remaining sympathetic to othes is a good key to always remember regardless so. For this, we'll just talk about it from a very understanding and speculative point of view, like
                            comparing the pain felt from a) having a chronic illness to b) losing a loved one to c) child birth. We can just/compare pain but not general hardship/difficulty. Anyways...<br><br>But yeah, I have found that health related
                            hardships build resilience/maturity the fastest. Example would be kids on the pediatric onco ward on their third round of chemo/radiation. It's a very obvious/strong example but I hope you see what I mean. &nbsp;<br><br>Apologies
                            for the long hiatus. Here's an important photo with cool information. I need not explain the elephant but yeah I agree big pharma SUCKS~~~, small/mid pharma ROCKS.&nbsp;<br><br>Cheers til next time, <br>vish<br><br><img src="/assets/img/rnd%20and%20profit%202014%20pharma%20firms%20LOL.png?h=bbdae0ee09370422325023521ee81931"><br>Some

Not much happened this week, but I'll include some stuff down below in "Thoughts". Also I have recently enjoyed using the word "Cheers" much more often. Variety in word usage is always welcome. Hands in the air for
                            linguistics and language!&nbsp;<br>________________________________________________________________<br><strong>What I'm reading:&nbsp;</strong><br>No super interesting papers I dived into this week. Hopefully this won't happen
                            often.&nbsp;<br><br>For thoes who are interested in children's health, pediatric disease, rare diseases, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and medicine, I found reading about the diseases on St. Jude's Children's Hospital list of
                            indications they treat to be actually VERY informative and fun. They distill complex rare conditions into well written and simple explanations, and provide sufficient statistics and information about how they care for children
                            with said condition. I LOVE this page.&nbsp;<br><br>https://www.stjude.org/disease.html<br><br>Sam Altman's new post got a LOT of attention for very obvious reasons.&nbsp;<br><br>http://blog.samaltman.com/<br><br>Elements<br>Pretty
                            cool book. Who would have knew? /s<br>_______________________________________________________________<br><strong>What I'm working on:&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Learning a bit about some tech stuff, and by tech stuff I mean trying
                            to resolve some DNS issues on Cloudflare. I know, very dissapointing.&nbsp;<br><br>I discovered this channel on Youtube called "NileRed"&nbsp;<br>If you like science, check it out.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/user/TheRedNile/videos<br>________________________________________________________________<br><strong>Thoughts:&nbsp;</strong><br><br>I
                            must say that this new "foodplan" I am trying it is pretty interesting. Essentially just high protein and low (read: basically none?) carbs, which as long as other micronutrients are consumed should be fine to consume. I was
                            advised that high protein is ok so long as you consume large amounts of water (and it doesn't hurt to exercise as well). Noted.<br><br>Essentially, we have eggs/oatmeal for breakfast, beef or chicken for lunch and then dinner
                            is the same as lunch. Along with baby carrots, salad, fruits (citrus, bananas, blueberries), and some seasonings/sauces, we have a very simple but sufficient food plan. Of course, there is room for tomatoes, avocados, and sweet
                            potatoes (the #1 carb of all time), but given sweet potatoes take more than a few minutes to prepare we have deferred them for now. Will try later and update.<br><br>Definitely not as "satiating" as a high carb or "outside-food"
                            diet, but most people agree that carbs can be heavy as well as no outside food brings total food costs down considerably. $10 for a meal is CRAZY.&nbsp;<br><br>I know that three things one should try their best not to sacrifice
                            quality for is a mattress, shoes, and the food they eat, but outside food is very, very expensive.&nbsp;<br><br>I want to comment on dreams next time.&nbsp;<br><br>Also congrats to the Patriots! I mean, I've been a Colts fan
                            since forever and am indifferent toward Brady, but I don't like the Rams, so Patriots it is. Game was VERY boring, but what can you do. Anyways, GOAT.&nbsp;<br><br>Usually, most people will either, to put it simply, be a fan
                            of kids and others will not be. This obviously changes with time. Not sure what this means or that it matters, but mainly I mentioned it to just say that I feel this is a binary operation (haha). Hit or miss.&nbsp;<br><br>Doing
                            sports makes physical exercise more stressful but MUCH more fun. Mostly competition, but also acheivement/mastery. Being good in ANYTHING (e.g. cutting green onions) makes people feel very good. Hard to beat the satisfaction
                            from skill/mastery. Not even money can compete I would wager.&nbsp;<br><br>Music is amazing. Namely classical/instrumental music, highly-lyrical music, and nostalgic music (songs/tunes you listened too in the past).&nbsp;<br><br>No

                            these short posts, I'll probably just open a journal, pick a random article, and highlight here. Longer posts will attempt to have more curated papers/advanced papers like Nature or something random: possibly selected from
                            here.&nbsp;<br>https://www.omicsonline.org/scientific-journals.php<br><br>Pharmacological Treatments for Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome:&nbsp;<br>A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis. Disher et. al. JAMA Pediatr.2019.doi:10.1001<br>This
                            was the first article I found on JAMA Pediatrics today; although it is a review paper, I didn't know much about NAS so I didn't mind reading about it (tl;dr: babies get withdrawal symptoms after birth when mom takes narcotics
                            during pregnancy). <br>Apparently morphine sucks for NAS; interesting. Even though morphine is standard-of-care I still don't like it that much. &nbsp;No one likes pruritus* (side note:&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0885-3924(98)00115-8">https://doi.org/10.1016/S0885-3924(98)00115-8</a>&nbsp;is
                            a kind of random case study on morphine-induced pruritus. I admit I am not very familiar with this but I can't be the only one who prefers/tolerates dilaudid&gt;morphine (from personal exp.))<br><br>Back on topic;<br>https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=neonatal-abstinence-syndrome-90-P02387
                            has some information on NAS...a brief overview.&nbsp;<br><br>The paper itself just seems to review a bunch of RCTs** and found buprenorphine or suboxone to be best, and phenobarbital/morphine to be worst. I mean...I don't have
                            a MD but I would gather that a drug to treat opioid dependence would work well? Maybe I'm missing something here. The "kind of?" obvious was stated, no serious evidence/conclusion was reached, I don't know. 3/10 paper.&nbsp;<br><br>*

                            Algebra. Fraleigh 7th ed.<br>paged through it; seems more digestible then some other abstract texts. cool.&nbsp;<br>Linear Algebra done Right (huh?). Axler 3rd ed.<br>A prof at SJSU wrote a "textbook" aka review book/supplementary
                            &nbsp;text for Linear; prof decides to use it as primary text. Book is actually so good and makes concepts seem relatable/simplified. Good beginner text for 2nd year linear I guess (and probably first year too).&nbsp;<br><br>Nothing
                            else at the moment. Likely next week I'll pick something else up.&nbsp;<br><br>Elements~<br>________________________________________________________________<br><strong>Thoughts:&nbsp;</strong><br><br>I was thinking about food/eating/diet/cost/efficiency/health
                            a bit earlier. Most people would agree that they WANT to be healthy, so they are receptive to changes/ideas about how to improve health. Food seems to play an important part since we seem to need it to live, so we'll start
                            here. We'll assume that drinkable water is readily available, along with other basic resources. <br><br>Side note: the water/food problem is still on the way to being solved; in an alternate universe I would help with that
                            but not for this life unfortunately. &nbsp;Maybe in my lifetime? Hopefully. I'm not a food scientist but I take it GMOs and new tech will help with that.&nbsp;<br><br>Water should be consumed in decently high volumes on the
                            basis that our bodies contain/run on water, there is a lot of water on the earth, and that if humans don't drink it in low amounts we die. Sounds reasonable.&nbsp;<br><br>I would imagine "recommended" amounts/values for MOST
                            THINGS by the USDA/FDA/other health organizations are reputable and good, but they are just that. Good. It is hard for a large majority of the population to take a great recommendation if it is much harder e.g. If we ran a
                            trial for people to drink 40oz, 60oz, 80oz, 100oz of water...compliance would decrease as you increase volume? I still think this makes sense.&nbsp;<br><br>Enough about water.&nbsp;<br><br>A stove, pan, microwave, and some
                            utensils can be used with a diet consisting of chicken, rice, veggies (frozen or salad), and supplementary items. Get some meat, carbs, veggies, fruits (citrus, blueberries). Sounds "balanced" and rather easy.&nbsp;<br><br>Eating
                            the same thing every day, given that this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">food plan</span> (diet isn't the right word IMO) has necessary macro/micronutrients is probably pretty good. Predictable, efficient, rather
                            easy.&nbsp;<br><br>Of course, it gets "boring" since humans thrive on novelty in EVERY aspect of life...so we decorate with seasoning/salt and sauces. Calories, sodium intake is whatever. Generally humans seem to have problems
                            with TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE of things...so I guess "moderation is key" is very valuable.&nbsp;<br><br>There is always more to say, but for another time.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, if you make chicken on a pan, be careful. Tenderloins
                            will sear quicker then they will cook on the inside if on high heat. Breasts and other chicken/meats vary but should be better...usually.&nbsp;<br><br>This turned into a very long and scattered post; my apologies. Here is a
                            cool picture from Reddit.&nbsp;<br><br>Reddit is pretty cool too; highly recommend.<br><br>2hrslater: I realized that I may just compile a bunch of rants/thoughts/ideas into a seperate post/article and keep the same format

                            seemed logical to think it may aid with GI issues as well...essentially stuff related to microbiome. This new way of aerobically preparing samples is good progress. The results didn't seem TOO impressive but obviously still
                            impressive (12/38 from test group acheived remission vs. 3/35 from placebo...not bad!).&nbsp;<br>Still some ways to go.&nbsp;<br><br>(BTW, Mendeley is something I have found to be very resourceful for managing my PDFs/articles.

                            starting a new semester of classes at school, so new subjects include but are not limited to: Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, and POSSIBLY some environmental science stuff. Still working on chemistry. <br><br>Maybe soon I'll

                            good at this football thing.&nbsp;<br><br>Was talking with someone about the idea of "sacrifice now for better later" or "enjoy now at the expense of later". This idea can be worded in an infinite amount of ways of course.
                            An example that may relate to students (rather cliche) is to spend a night studying or go party. &nbsp;It is very hard to quantify the gain from 1, 2, or x hours of studying vs. a night with potentially high levels of fun and
                            novelty, but most people would agree that hard things take time, and that time needs to be put in somewhere e.g. habits.&nbsp;<br><br>Right now I'm not certain on which is better; pretty sure it would vary per the situation.&nbsp;<br><br>Pro
                            Tip: Keeping a bottle of Purell/your choice of hand sanitizer on a desk or work area or in a high traffic area is VERY worth.&nbsp;<br>The benefits of being able to sanitize your hands easily and in a very conveinent manner
                            outweighs the extra cost. A 10oz bottle will last you a whole 365 days EASILY, but likely 2+ years.&nbsp;<br>Also, when your hands feel dry or "dirty", it seems to fix that problem too.&nbsp;<br><br>If not, then a sink and
                            some hand soap will be good too.&nbsp;<br>Don't wanna get sick during flu/cold/sniffle season!&nbsp;<br><br>Also, don't forget to stay warm in these colder months!&nbsp;<br>Nothing beats a warm puffy jacket and some gloves.&nbsp;<br><br>Til

At bare minimum, it can catalog different things that I am doing
                            since journaling/keeping a record privately never seems to work. <em>Habits are hard to build.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I have taken inspiration from Martin Shkreli's blog format (found at martinshkreli.com). There is considerable
                            overlap over our shared interests as he is one of the reasons why I discovered/took interest in pharmaceticals/science (seriously) among other things. I mean, chemistry class in grade school was cool but how do you relate a
                            16 year old learning about quantum spin to something practical? At least for me, studying drugs and realizing that # of H bonds is relevant when it comes to whether drugs may "work"&nbsp;(e.g lipinski's rule of 5).
