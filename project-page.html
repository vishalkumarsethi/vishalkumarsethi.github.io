Cheers to a good semester of work, progress, and a little bit of fun.&nbsp;<br>________________________________________________________________<br><strong>What I'm reading:&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Effect
                            of Fecal Microbiota Trasnplantation on 8-Week Remission in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis. Costello et. al. JAMA<em>&nbsp;</em>2019;321(2):156-164.<br>Since FMT &nbsp;began to become more popular with treating C. Diff, it
                            seemed logical to think it may aid with GI issues as well...essentially stuff related to microbiome. This new way of aerobically preparing samples is good progress. The results didn't seem TOO impressive but obviously still
                            impressive (12/38 from test group acheived remission vs. 3/35 from placebo...not bad!).&nbsp;<br>Still some ways to go.&nbsp;<br><br>(BTW, Mendeley is something I have found to be very resourceful for managing my PDFs/articles.
                            Highly recommend.)<br><br>Elements \\ Euclid<br>I'ma put this on the bottom always and not comment anymore on it since I'm moving at what seems to be one page per week.&nbsp;<br><br>Didn't get to read much this week. :(<br>________________________________________________________________<br><strong>What I'm working on:&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Just
                            starting a new semester of classes at school, so new subjects include but are not limited to: Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, and POSSIBLY some environmental science stuff. Still working on chemistry. <br><br>Maybe soon I'll
                            finish the tutorials I started x years ago on Code.org.&nbsp;<br>________________________________________________________________<br><strong>Thoughts:&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Patriots vs. Chiefs goodness me. Tom Brady is pretty
                            good at this football thing.&nbsp;<br><br>Was talking with someone about the idea of "sacrifice now for better later" or "enjoy now at the expense of later". This idea can be worded in an infinite amount of ways of course.
                            An example that may relate to students (rather cliche) is to spend a night studying or go party. &nbsp;It is very hard to quantify the gain from 1, 2, or x hours of studying vs. a night with potentially high levels of fun and
                            novelty, but most people would agree that hard things take time, and that time needs to be put in somewhere e.g. habits.&nbsp;<br><br>Right now I'm not certain on which is better; pretty sure it would vary per the situation.&nbsp;<br><br>Pro
                            Tip: Keeping a bottle of Purell/your choice of hand sanitizer on a desk or work area or in a high traffic area is VERY worth.&nbsp;<br>The benefits of being able to sanitize your hands easily and in a very conveinent manner
                            outweighs the extra cost. A 10oz bottle will last you a whole 365 days EASILY, but likely 2+ years.&nbsp;<br>Also, when your hands feel dry or "dirty", it seems to fix that problem too.&nbsp;<br><br>If not, then a sink and
                            some hand soap will be good too.&nbsp;<br>Don't wanna get sick during flu/cold/sniffle season!&nbsp;<br><br>Also, don't forget to stay warm in these colder months!&nbsp;<br>Nothing beats a warm puffy jacket and some gloves.&nbsp;<br><br>Til

                        <p style="height: auto;color: rgb(0,0,0);font-size: 17.6;font-family: Lato, sans-serif;">I have come to a point of my journey to create a website from "scratch" where I should begin writing stuff down here as I plan to maintain it at least through 2019. At bare minimum, it can catalog different things that I am doing
                            since journaling/keeping a record privately never seems to work. <em>Habits are hard to build.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I have taken inspiration from Martin Shkreli's blog format (found at martinshkreli.com). There is considerable
                            overlap over our shared interests as he is one of the reasons why I discovered/took interest in pharmaceticals/science (seriously) among other things. I mean, chemistry class in grade school was cool but how do you relate a
                            16 year old learning about quantum spin to something practical? At least for me, studying drugs and realizing that # of H bonds is relevant when it comes to whether drugs may "work"&nbsp;(e.g lipinski's rule of 5). But I digress.&nbsp;<br><br>Posts
                            2-3x a week? Shouldn't be that bad.&nbsp;<br>________________________________________________________________<br><strong>What I'm reading:&nbsp;</strong><br><br>The Actinic Cheilitis of Hereditary Polymorphic Light Eruption.
                            Birt et. al. Arch Dermatol. 1979;115(6):699-702<br>Interesting article about cheilitis. Actually it's not THAT interesting. There isn't much about cheilitis anyways. Sad.&nbsp;<br><br>(I am VERY thankful for my university which
                            provides free journal access. If you attend a college/university and want to read full articles/journals FREE OF CHARGE, do look into it. Very cool.)<br><br>Elements \\ Euclid<br>Started this one recently. Gonna take me a while.&nbsp;<br>Need

                            I had $x M, I'd donate first to Julio Gonzalez @ The Organic Chemistry Tutor. Videos are A+.&nbsp;<br><br>________________________________________________________________<br><strong>Thoughts:&nbsp;</strong><br><br>The Colts
                            losing in the Playoffs was :( but I'm proud of how far they went.&nbsp;<br><br>Music is better when you discover it yourself vs. someone else telling you to listen to a song.<br><br>Cool thing to do (if you have a bullet journal,
                            passion planner, or personal notebook, etc.) is Year In Pixels. The only thing that may vary would be the day descriptions. Google "My Year in Pixels" for different images/descriptions. This one from Reddit is what I use. Works
